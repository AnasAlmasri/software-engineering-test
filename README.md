# Supahands Coding Test Alternate
* This is a coding test for prospective supahands engineers. 
* This is the alternate test given to non CS majors who may think that an graph algorithm test unfairly test their software engineering skills
* The seed file should not be modified, it is expected to generate a list of random timestamps to be used in the test

## Submission Instructions
* Clone this repo
* Make a FORK, and then create a PR for the FORK when you are ready for answer submission!
* Place your solutions files in the same directory as the seed.py file
* You can solve the problem using either python, nodejs, ruby, golang, java or typescript
* Notify [careers@supahands.com](mailto:careers@supahands.com) upon PR request with link to PR.

## Hints
* If you do not know the fork and generate PR workflow, please read this [guide](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962)

## Problem Statement
* Given a list of time stamps that is generated by the provided seed.py
* Determine the longest series of consecutive logins on a daily basis.
 * For example, if given the following timestamps ...['2021-03-13 15:13:05', '2021-03-13 23:13:05', '2021-03-16 15:13:05', '2021-03-16 23:13:05', '2021-03-17 07:13:05', '2021-03-17 15:13:05', '2021-03-17 23:13:05', '2021-03-18 07:13:05', '2021-03-18 15:13:05']
 * Since the longest period of consecutive logins occur from 2021-03-16 to 2021-03-18, the answer would be

| START      | END        | LENGTH |
|------------|------------|--------|
| 2021-03-16 | 2021-03-18 |      3 |

* The problem stems from needing to award badges for consecutive logins in order to reward good behavior as demonstrated by a Supahands labeler

## Expected Solution
* Present the solution as a python/ruby/typescript/nodejs script file.

## Outputs
Our test script expects a stdout of the following format
| START      | END        | LENGTH |
|------------|------------|--------|
| 2021-03-03 | 2021-03-10 |      8 |
