# Supahands Coding Test Alternate
* This is a coding test for prospective supahands engineers. 
* This is the alternate test given to non CS majors who may think that an graph algorithm test unfairly test their software engineering skills
* The seed file should not be modified, it is expected to generate a list of random timestamps to be used in the test

## Submission Instructions
* Clone this repo
* Make a FORK, and then create a PR for the FORK when you are ready for answer submission!
* Solve the test in python/ruby/typescript/nodejs in the same directory as the seed.py file
* Notify  [careers@supahands.com](mailto:careers@supahands.com) upon PR request with link to PR.

## Hints
* If you do not know fork and generate PR workflow, please read this [guide](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962)

## Problem Statement
* Determine the longest series of daily consecutive logins using the timestamps generated by seed.py
* The timestamps being generated by seed.py represent the login times of of an anonymous data labeler working with Supahands

## Solution Hints
* Run the seed.py file
* You probably want to store the timestamps generated somewhere or somehow
* Write a script to determine the longest series of daily consecutive logins using the timestamps


## Expected Solution
* Present the solution as a python/ruby/typescript/nodejs script file.

## Outputs
Our test script expects a stdout of the following format
| START      | END        | LENGTH |
|------------|------------|--------|
| 2021-03-03 | 2021-03-10 |      8 |
