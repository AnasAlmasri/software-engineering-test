# Supahands Coding Test Alternate
* This is a coding test for prospective supahands engineers. 
* This is the alternate test given to non CS majors who may think that an graph algorithm test unfairly test their software engineering skills
* The seed file should not be modified, it is expected to generate a list of random timestamps to be used in the test

## Instructions
* Clone this repo
* Solve the test in python/ruby/typescript/nodejs in the same directory as the seed file
* Make a FORK, and then create a PR for the FORK when you are ready for answer submission!
* If you do not know this workflow, please read this [guide](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962)
* Notify  [careers@supahands.com](mailto:careers@supahands.com) upon PR request with link to PR.

## Problem Statement
* Given a list of time stamps that is generated by seed.py
* Determine the longest series of daily consecutive logins.
* The problem stems from needing to award badges for consecutive logins in order to reward good behavior as demonstrated by a Supahands labeler

## Expected Solution
* Present the solution as a python/ruby/typescript/nodejs script file.

## Outputs
Our test script expects a stdout of the following format
| START      | END        | LENGTH |
